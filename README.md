# FOL-language-Comprehension
First Order Logic Comprehension to determine clauses.


This project implements the theorem of first-order logic(FOL) to determine if the satisfiability of a knowledge-based sentence is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) - This is determined by quantifying the FOL languages predicates, variables, constants, functions, and clauses - and applying to the resolution technique to check if there is an empty clause with either yes or no output. The tasks the Python file solves are unification, clause comparison, and substitution handling. 

FOL.py - the python code to solve first-order logic statements for clauses. 

tests - the tests used to determine the reliability of code - 100% accuracy detailed results.pdf.

results.pdf - the test outcomes of all tests ran from the tests folder.
